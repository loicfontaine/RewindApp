# Rewind

## Description

Rewind is a web application built with Nuxt.js. This application has been developped for Liip during my Bachelor thesis. My goal was to develop a Proof Of Concept (POC) to automate timesheeting.


The application is deployed and publicly accessible, but you need to be Liip's employee to use the app. That's why I've deployed a demo version of my application too.
